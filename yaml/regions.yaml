Pria:
  Name: Pria
  Description: The starting region, a rural and under-developed area that largely escaped the ravages of war by being too small to notice.
  Ports:
    Veldis:
      Name: Pria -> Veldis
      Fare: 500
      Duration: 30
Veldis:
  Name: Veldis
  Description: Veldis used to be a relatively rural minor region, but after The Fracturing it became the primary supplier of food to Tyldia. The Merchant Syndicate purchased every plot of land on Veldis and hired mages to flatten hills, dig irrigation, and enchant the soil to ensure enough capacity to feed the city.

Skellig:
  Name: Skellig

Tritum:
  Name: Tritum
  Description: Known before The Fracturing as The Bastion of the West, Tritum's population is divided into warrior and peasant castes. Peasants largely practice subsistence hunting and gathering in Tritum's vast forests, while the warrior caste is contracted by the Merchant Syndicate of Tyldia to guard the traderoute from Veldis.

Yoggoth:
  Name: Yoggoth
