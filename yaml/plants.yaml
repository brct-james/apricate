Wagyu Fungus:
  Name: Wagyu Fungus
  Description: The Wagyu Fungus is a type of fungus that only grows in the hollow interior of the Uona Tree. The tree is worthless as a building material, as it is extremely brittle when dry. The Wagyu Fungus has a symbiotic relationship as it hydrates the tree, while the tree's hardness protects the fungus. Its flavor and texture resemble that of fine steak, and is revered in several religions as the 'Food of the Gods'. Once the tree is grown, the fungus may be harvested indefinitely.
